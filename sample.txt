This assignment is based on Exercise 8.4 from your textbook. Each of the following Python functions is supposed to check whether its argument has any lowercase letters.


For each function, describe what it actually does when called with a string argument. If it does not correctly check for lowercase letters, give an example argument that produces incorrect results, and describe why the result is incorrect.

# 1

def any_lowercase1(s):
     for c in s:
          if c.islower():
               return True
          else:
               return False


# 2

def any_lowercase2(s):
     for c in s:
          if 'c'.islower():
               return 'True'
          else:
               return 'False'


# 3

def any_lowercase3(s):
     for c in s:
          flag = c.islower()
     return flag


# 4

def any_lowercase4(s):
     flag = False
     for c in s:
          flag = flag or c.islower()
     return flag


# 5

def any_lowercase5(s):
     for c in s:
          if not c.islower():
               return False
     return True

# 1
def any_lowercase1(s):
     for c in s:
          if c.islower():
               return True
          else:
               return False

Function #1 iterates over string and return True if taken for iteration letter is lowercase, or False otherwise. The problem here is that only the first letter will be checked because the return statement will end the whole function. The wrong result will be for any input string that starts with an uppercase letter, for example, "Test".

# 2
def any_lowercase2(s):
     for c in s:
          if 'c'.islower():
               return 'True'
          else:
               return 'False'

Function #2 always returns "True" string because it checks if string "c" is lowercase, and it actually is. If I pass "UP" this will return "True" string and the result will always be the same.

# 3
def any_lowercase3(s):
     for c in s:
          flag = c.islower()
     return flag

Function #3 returns True is the last letter of string is lowercase, because the flag value is changed for each letter of string. For example, output for "tesT" will be False.


# 4
def any_lowercase4(s):
     flag = False
     for c in s:
          flag = flag or c.islower()
     return flag

Function #4 looks like a correct one in terms of results. If one of the letters in the string is lowercase, then the flag value will be changed to True as "False or True" will result to true, and then any other combination "True or False" and "True or True" will be true. That means we get correct result for any string input. So, here all string inputs with lowercase will result to True, and to False otherwise.

# 5
def any_lowercase5(s):
     for c in s:
          if not c.islower():
               return False
     return True

Function #5 will return False if any letter of the string is not lowercase. So, for inputs like "teSt", "tesT", "Test" etc. the result will be False, which is wrong. True will be the case only if all letters of the string are lowercase.

Good and accurate answers. but have you tried calling the function with lowercase in different position? i haven't. i was just wondering? otherwise. work well done!

#1 This function is wrong for checking whether a string contains any lowercase letters. Because the function is finished when 'return' runs, this #1 function can check only the first letter of an argument. So, for example, an argument 'Abc', will output False, although it contains lowercases b and c.
>>> any_lowercase1('Abc')
False

#2 This function is wrong for checking whether a string contains any lowercase letters. Because the string 'c' of lowercase is used instead of variable c, the if conditional statement returns True at any time. So, for example, an argument, 'A', will output True, although A is uppercase. Additionally, the both return values of 'True' and 'False' are string, too. In this sense, this function is wrong, too
>>> any_lowercase2('A')
'True'

#3 This function is wrong for checking whether a string contains any lowercase letters, too. Because the content of the variable 'flag' changes every time in the for loop, the function returns False when the last letter of an argument is uppercase. So, for example, the function with an argument 'abC' returns False, although a and b are lowercase.
>>> any_lowercase3('abC')
False

#4 This function is correct for checking whether a string contains any lowercase letters. In this function, a sum-set operation is used when assigning a value to the variable flag in the for loop. In other words, the answer of 'False or False' is False, but the answers of 'True or True', 'True or False' and 'False or True' are True. Thanks to this, once the content of the variable 'flag' becomes True, the content doesn't change anymore. So if there is even one lowercase letter, the output will be True, and if an argument is all uppercase, the output will be False.

#5 This function is correct for checking whether a string contains any lowercase letters, too. If there is even a single uppercase letter, False is returned at that point; if all are lowercase, True is returned after the loop is completed. Therefore, this function is correct.

Hi Mimori Kyoma,
I think #5 function is not correct. If the string argument is "STRing", the function will return False. Since the function is supposed to check whether its argument has any lowercase letters. Also, "STRing" contains lowercase letters. The function should return True to be a correct function when "STRing" is given as an argument.

Hello, Pascoal.
I was glad that your outputs of each code are same as mine. However, it seemed that there are no explanations about what each code actually did. Also, if you possible, you should think about indenting and formatting your code so that it is easy to understand and works quickly when copied and pasted.

Hi Pascoal Bonito,
You need to explain more about the code. I think you have a typo in #1 since you call any_lowercase2 function before defining it. To format the code, you first need to click Advanced when replying the post. Then, select the code and click the 'A' button with an arrow pointing downwards. After that, you need to select Pre-formatted even if the code looks already preformatted. You can also change the format after you posted to the forum in five minutes. During that five minutes, you need to check your post format and errors. You can edit any format or typos in five minutes.

# 1
#INPUT:
def any_lowercase1(s):
for c in s:
if c.islower():
return True
else:
return False

print(any_lowercase1("BaNana"))# This will return False
print(any_lowercase1("bananA"))# This will return True
print(any_lowercase1("BANANa"))# This will return False

#OUTPUT:
=== RESTART: C:/Users/dell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/Scripts/SX.py ===
False
True
False

Only the first letter of the string is checked in this situation. If it's a lower case letter, it'll return True; if it's not, it'll return False, irrespective of whether the string contains any other lower case letters.

#INPUT:
# 2
def any_lowercase2(s):
for c in s:
if 'c'.islower():
return 'True'
else:
return 'False'
print(any_lowercase2("BanAna"))#This will return True
print(any_lowercase2("bananA"))# This will return True
print(any_lowercase2(" "))# This will return True

#OUTPUT:
=== RESTART: C:/Users/dell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/Scripts/SX.py ===
True
True
True

Because the function is only examining the "c" in the quotation while it is declared, it will always return true even if there are no lower case letters because it is only examining the "c" alone.
It also returns yes and false as strings rather than a boolean value.

#INPUT:
#3
def any_lowercase3(s):
for c in s:
flag = c.islower()
return flag

print(any_lowercase3("BaNanA"))# This will return False
print(any_lowercase3("bananA"))# This will return False
print(any_lowercase3("BANana"))# This will return True

#OUTPUT:
=== RESTART: C:/Users/dell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/Scripts/SX.py ===
False
False
True

This function only evaluates the string's last character; it will return true if the string's last character is in lower case. It will return false even though every other character is lower case except the last one

#INPUT:
# 4
def any_lowercase4(s):
flag = False
for c in s:
flag = flag or c.islower()
return flag
print(any_lowercase4("bAnanA"))# This will return True
print(any_lowercase4("bananA"))# This will return True
print(any_lowercase4("BANANA"))# This will return False

#OUTPUT:
=== RESTART: C:/Users/dell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/Scripts/SX.py ===
True
True
False

This is the function that does exactly what we want it to do. It will examine each character in the string and return true if any is lower case and false if nothing else is.

#INPUT:
# 5
def any_lowercase5(s):
for c in s:
if not c.islower():
return False
return True

print(any_lowercase5("banana"))#This will return True
print(any_lowercase5("bananA"))#This will return False
print(any_lowercase5("BANANA")) #This will return False

#OUTPUT:
=== RESTART: C:/Users/dell/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/Scripts/SX.py ===
True
False
False

Answer: 1
Python Script 
def any_lowercase1(s):
     for c in s:
          if c.islower():
               return True
          else:
               return False

Output Script 
Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

= RESTART: D:\Users\khan.daniyal\OneDrive - Mitsubishi Electric Saudi Ltd\Desktop\Test.py

>>>any_lowercase1('Cat') 
False

any_lowercase1('cat')
True

Description: 
When I interpret the first time with a capital letter C for an argument Cat then after that I run it, I got False in the output result but when I interpret second time with a small letter c for an argument cat and after that, I run it. I got True in the output result because in python the result is totally based on the first letter of the string like here in our program, we used s. So, in python, the first character of the string is tested first and then after that, it returns a Boolean statement. 

Answer: 2

Python Script 

def any_lowercase2(s):
     for c in s:
          if 'c'.islower():
               return 'True'
          else:
               return 'False'
print (any_lowercase2('Apple'))
print (any_lowercase2('apple'))
print ( any_lowercase2('APPLE'))

Output
Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

= RESTART: D:\Users\khan.daniyal\OneDrive - Mitsubishi Electric Saudi Ltd\Desktop\Test.py

True
True
True

Description: 
In this function I got the True result 3 times in the output as I used the first uppercase letter, then all lowercase letters, and then all uppercase letters but in all conditions, I got True result why because this function checks only the string ’c ’ with quotation marks which is a lowercase that’s why always return True.

Answer3:

Python Script:

def any_lowercase3(s):
     for c in s:
          flag = c.islower()
     return flag
print (any_lowercase3('Orange'))
print (any_lowercase3('orange'))
print (any_lowercase3('ORANGE'))
print (any_lowercase3('orangE'))

Output:
Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

= RESTART: D:\Users\khan.daniyal\OneDrive - Mitsubishi Electric Saudi Ltd\Desktop\Test.py
True
True
False
False

Description: 
In this function  I have mentioned orange in a print statement 4 times with different letters like first I put O uppercase and all lowercase letters after that all lowercase letters and the third one all uppercase letters and the last one is all lowercase except the last character and in the output result, I got TRUE 2 times and False also 2 times why because the result depends on the last letter of the given string as if the last character is uppercase the result will be False otherwise it will be True.






Answer 4:

def any_lowercase4(s):
     flag = False
     for c in s:
          flag = flag or c.islower()
     return flag

print (any_lowercase4('Mango'))
print (any_lowercase4('mangO'))
print (any_lowercase4('mango'))
print (any_lowercase4('MANGO'))

Output:
Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

= RESTART: D:\Users\khan.daniyal\OneDrive - Mitsubishi Electric Saudi Ltd\Desktop\Test.py
True
True
True
False

Description:
This function is working correctly because in this function 'flag' is equal to False and it has the variable of a Boolean expression. In this function, I got True 3 times and False one time in an output result. In the first time, the first letter M was capital and the second time last letter O was capital 
third, all lowercase letters, and the fourth one is all uppercase letters.So, the last word MANGO was capital due to that it raised the flag which is equal to False that’s why it displays False in the output result. 

Answer5: 

def any_lowercase5(s):
     for c in s:
          if not c.islower():
               return False
     return True
print (any_lowercase5('danger'))
print (any_lowercase5('Danger'))
print (any_lowercase5('dangeR'))
print (any_lowercase5('DANGER'))

Output:
Python 3.10.0 (tags/v3.10.0:b494f59, Oct  4 2021, 19:00:18) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

= RESTART: D:\Users\khan.daniyal\OneDrive - Mitsubishi Electric Saudi Ltd\Desktop\Test.py
True
False
False
False

Description:
In this function, I got 1 True and 3 False output results. This is because if all letters in an argument which is danger is lowercase then it will
return True otherwise it will return False because of the 'not' logical operator which is a Boolean Expression that makes True be False.

Dear Brother, I have explained there that the function flag = False, and in the Output result i Received True 3 times and False 1 time and
after that, I explained how I got True 3 times and False 1 time
which means according to the program it will not show the False result unless all letters of a word are uppercase or in Capital letters. I hope that it will clear your double.

# 1
def any_lowercase1(s):
     for c in s:
          if c.islower():
               return True
          else:
               return False
print(any_lowercase1("Apple"))
Output:
False

Explanation for #1:

This function any_lowercase1 checks only if the first character of the string is in lowercase. Although the function traverses the string, the function will return True if the first character is in lowercase or will return False if the first character is not in lowercase. The loop iterates only once and returns True or False. So, the function will not iterate through the end of the string.

When calling the function any_lowercase1 with a string argument "Apple", the function only checked the first character 'A' and returned False. The function did not check the remaining lowercase characters 'pple'. Therefore, the any_lowercase1 function is wrong.

# 2
def any_lowercase2(s):
     for c in s:
          if 'c'.islower():
               return 'True'
          else:
               return 'False'
print(any_lowercase2("APPLE"))
Output:
True

Explanation for #2:

This function any_lowercase2 will always return 'True' because the if condition statement 'c'.islower() is true. The function will never return 'False' if the string is given as an argument. This function also iterates only once.

When calling the function any_lowercase2 with a string argument "APPLE", the function returns 'True' because the boolean expression is always true. This function did not check the string argument. Therefore, the any_lowercase2 function is wrong.

# 3
def any_lowercase3(s):
     for c in s:
          flag = c.islower()
     return flag
print(any_lowercase3("fruiT"))
Output:
False

Explanation for #3:

This function any_lowercase3 stores the boolean value in the local variable named flag. But, as the function traverses through the string, flag is updated its boolean value in string traversal. At the end of string traversal, flag has the boolean value which depends on the last character of the string. If the last character is in lowercase, flag has the value of True. Otherwise, flag has the value of False. This function any_lowercase3 returns the flag after the loop is completed. So, only the last character of the string is checked.

When calling the function any_lowercase3 with a string argument "fruiT", the last character of the string is not in lowercase, so the function returns False. Although every character of the string is checked, flag is updated with the last character at the end. So, flag has the boolean value of False when "fruiT" is given as an argument. Therefore, the any_lowercase3 function is wrong.

# 4
def any_lowercase4(s):
     flag = False
     for c in s:
          flag = flag or c.islower()
     return flag
print(any_lowercase4("STRiNG"))
print(any_lowercase4("LARGE"))
Output:
True
False

Explanation for #4:

The function any_lowercase4 is working correctly. The variable flag is first assigned with the boolean value of False. Then, flag is updated using the logical operator 'or' during the string traversal. Each character is checked if it is in lowercase or not by a string method islower(). And, compare the result with flag, which is first assigned with False, using the logical operator 'or'. When the islower() method returns True, the variable flag is updated True. Once the flag is True, it cannot be False again because of the logical operator or. After the string traversal, the function returns flag.

When calling the function any_lowercase4 with a string argument "STRiNG", flag is False when traversing "STR" and is True when reaching 'i'. Then, it cannot be false again. At the end, the function returns True.

When calling the function any_lowercase4 with a string argument "LARGE", the function returns False since the string has no lowercase letters.

# 5
def any_lowercase5(s):
    for c in s:
        if not c.islower():
           return False
    return True
print(any_lowercase5("Bag"))
Output:
False

Explanation for #5:

The function any_lowercase5 checks if all characters in the string are in lowercase. If they are in the lowercase, the function returns True. If there is any character that is not in the lowercase, the function returns False.

When calling the function any_lowercase5 with a string argument "Bag", the function returns False because the first character 'B' is not in lowercase. Therefore, this function any_lowercase5 is wrong.

def any_lowercase5(s):
for c in s:
